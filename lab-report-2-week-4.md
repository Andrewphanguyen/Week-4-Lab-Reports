Symptom
![alt text](8.jpg)
* The bug is that the HashMap was expecting a string Array as the value of the HashMap instead of an ArrayList and so the types were wrong
* The symptom was that the program couldn't identify what the variable was due to the types being wrong 
* The failure inducing input was using the testfile1.md file in order to test the Hashmap getting input of the string array which as a result created a error.
